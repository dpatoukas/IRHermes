# IRHermes
Experimental power-intermittent communication protocol over IR


##Motivation 
This libary was designed for communicatining information from a power-intermittent device to a power-stable station.
This work is a product for an IoT seminar conducted in TUDelft and has purely academic purposes.
The power-stable station is an ArduinoUno and that is the reason this library was largely designed upon [IRRemote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)
